# calculator-challenge
This is my first project. It is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It is a simple calculator that will take inputs from users clicks and return outputs. The operations that can run are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

My inspiration for the design comes from these posts on Muzli.
