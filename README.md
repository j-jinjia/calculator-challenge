# calculator-challenge
This is my first project. It is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It is a simple calculator that will take up to 2 inputs from users clicks and return an output as result.
The operations that can run are addition, subtraction, multiplication,division and percentage.
It includes a clear button as well as decimal button.

My inspiration for the design comes from these posts on Muzli.
