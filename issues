ISSUES
1.- minus negative numbers displaying wrong values [solved]

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
1.- Operand can't be first input.  [Pending]
        Using if statement to check wether the first input is a number or operand. If it's number, carry on with the next if statement.
        if it's operand, display on screen " Syntax Error"
2.- operations for more than 2 inputs/group numbers [Pending]
3.- Improvement: On pressing percentage: display directly the result instead of clicking equal button.
